    <h1>WELCOME TO VOLCANO ISLAND!</h1>
    <h2 class="Joey">Our Magnificent Joseph</h2>
        <p>  
            As one of the co-founders of Volcano Island,
            Joseph was often seen battling (like below) for the 
            honor and dignity of an idea rooted in perfection: 
            Volcano Island
        </p>

    <h2 class="Ari">Our Magnificent Ariel</h2>
        <p>
            As the second co-founder of Volcano Island,
            Ariel was the "man with a plan." If it is not
            blatantly obvious from his business-ready demeanor
            (seen below), let us assure you that he is always 
            down to clown.

    <h2 class="Dasha">Our Magnificent Dariya</h2>
        <p>
            As the third co-founder of Volcano Island,
            Dariya was.... wait who are we kidding? She wasn't a founder!
            BUT, she is mayhaps the <strong>best</strong> intern around. 
            Dariya comes equipped with every skill known to be useful
            on our island! If you have any questions, please reach out to her.
