    <h2 class="Joey">Our Magnificent Joseph</h2>
    <p>  
        As one of the co-founders of Volcano Island,
        Joseph was often seen battling (like below) for the 
        honor and dignity of an idea rooted in perfection: <br>
        <strong>Volcano Island</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="Ari">Our Magnificent Ariel</h2>
    <p>
        As the second co-founder of Volcano Island,
        Ariel was the "man with a plan." <br>
        If it is not blatantly obvious from his business-ready demeanor
        (seen below), let us assure you that he is always 
        down to clown.

    <h2 class="Dasha">Our Magnificent Dariya</h2>
    <p>
        As the third co-founder of Volcano Island,
        Dariya was.... wait who are we kidding? She wasn't a founder!<br>
        BUT, she is mayhaps the <em>best</em> intern around. 
        Dariya comes equipped with every skill known to be useful
        on our island!<br>
        If you have any questions, please reach out to her. <br>
